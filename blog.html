        <p><i>We've outsourced our memories to digital devices, and the result is that we no longer trust our memories.<br />
          We see every small forgotten thing as evidence that they're failing us.</i><br />

        Through archival inkjet prints, I unveil glitched-out digital scans of childhood Polaroid photographs taken by my paternal grandmother in the early-2000s.
        These glitched sections, with their revealing and concealing color blocks, engage in a discourse about memory degradation.
        The manipulated images serve as poignant reminders of the temporal disconnect created by frozen moments, embodying the bittersweet nature of memory.
        Beyond a mere visual narrative, the series examines the human body's perpetual movement, delving into the eventual loss of physical objects.
        The photographs, acting as memory aids, become tangible anchors for the intangible realm of memory, symbolizing the poignant death of their subjects, forever fixed in a moment while the world evolves around them.

      <h2>LET FLOWERS GROW FROM MY ROTTING BODY</h2>

        <p><i>From my rotting body, flowers shall grow<br />
          and I am in them, and that is eternity.</i><br />

        In this 3D animation, a virtual home serves as a poignant backdrop.
        The camera delicately zooms in on two embracing skeletons, encapsulating the profound shift in familial context that death brings.
        Inspired by Edvard Munch's evocative quote, the video elegantly explores the transformative beauty of decay.
        Rooted in the 1st Law of Thermodynamics, the animation weaves the narrative of our energy persisting post-mortem, fostering life and becoming an integral part of the Earth's eternal cycle.
